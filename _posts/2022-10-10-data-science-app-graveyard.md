In 2019, I developed and deployed several of my mini data science apps on Heroku. It's remarkable how time flies, and right from the beginning, I had a feeling that eventually the apps would resemble what they are (dead apps lol) today. Maintaining them has always been unexciting yet still costly in contrast to the thrill of new development.
